// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements= "This is the second step of deveplopment cycle. Developers need to see what are the requirements before they start."

const design= " This step requires a lot of cooperation between developers and other specs. Everyone needs to collaborate to be able to desing what the client asks for."

const testingAndIntegration= "This needs to be done before submitting the client. Developers and other specs people need to solve any bug that it is int the system."

const implementation="Developers will implement their desings with using code to the desired location or app. "

const maintain= "Developers needs to make sure to maintain working design for their client and solving any unwanted situatios."
